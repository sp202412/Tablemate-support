Tablemate Travel Lens  — Terms of Service 

Effective date: 17 December 2025
Operator: “Tablemate Travel Lens ” (“we,” “us,” “our”)
Contact: tablemateprices@gmail.com  

1) What these Terms cover
These Terms govern your use of the Tablemate Travel Lens mobile application and any related services, software, and content (the “Service”). By installing or using the Service, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.

2) Definitions
•	Application (App): the Tablemate Travel Lens mobile application you install.
•	Service: the App and any related features, software, content, and support we provide.
•	Augmented Reality (AR): computer-generated overlays that appear on your live camera view.
•	Optical Character Recognition (OCR): automated detection of text within images or video frames.
•	User Content: text or other material you submit or cause the App to process (for example, detected price strings or notes).
•	Outputs: on-screen overlays, estimated currency conversions, translations, or explanations produced by the Service.

3) What Tablemate Travel Lens does
The Service uses on-device camera processing (including OCR) to detect prices on menus, receipts, or labels and overlay estimated currency conversions in AR. If you choose translation or explanation features, the App may send limited text snippets (not full images) to our servers to generate an Output. Outputs are convenience estimates; the Service does not process payments, remit funds, execute currency trades, or provide financial advice or a price guarantee.

4) Safe and lawful use; eligibility
Use the Service only where lawful and with appropriate situational awareness. AR can be distracting—do not use while driving or in hazardous settings. You must be old enough to use the Service under your local law; if you are a minor, a parent or legal guardian must review and accept these Terms and supervise your use.

5) Your license
We grant you a personal, limited, non-exclusive, revocable license to install and use the App on devices you own or control, solely for its intended purpose under these Terms. We reserve all rights not expressly granted. You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, rent, lease, sublicense, reverse engineer, or circumvent technical limits except where applicable law permits.

6) Your content and our necessary permissions
You retain your rights in your User Content. You grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to host, process, and display User Content only as needed to operate, secure, troubleshoot, and improve the Service, and to comply with law. You confirm you have the rights required for us to process User Content for these purposes.

7) How features process data
The App processes camera frames locally to detect text for AR overlays. For optional translations or explanations you activate, the App may send text snippets to our servers to produce Outputs. We may retrieve and cache exchange-rate information to generate conversion estimates and improve responsiveness. Some core functions can operate without network connectivity; cloud-based features and analytics require an internet connection. Details about personal data, retention, and your choices appear in our separate Privacy Policy.

8) Prohibited uses
You agree not to:
•	Use the Service unlawfully, unsafely, or to infringe privacy or intellectual-property rights.
•	Scrape, extract, or bulk download exchange-rate sources or databases underlying the Service.
•	Interfere with, probe, or bypass security or technical restrictions.
•	Build a competing dataset or product primarily from the Service’s Outputs or behavior.
•	Use Outputs to misrepresent prices or deceive consumers.
•	Present the Service as a means to process payments, remit funds, or execute trades.

9) Accuracy and limitations
OCR, translation, and AR alignment can be inaccurate or fail due to lighting, motion, fonts, occlusion, device sensors, exchange-rate volatility, or connectivity. Outputs are estimates and may differ from merchant charges or card-network settlements. Verify results that matter before you rely on them. Dish explanations and translations are informational and not medical, nutritional, or dietary advice; verify ingredients and allergens directly with the restaurant.

10) Third-party components and platforms
The Service relies on mobile operating systems, device capabilities, and hosted infrastructure we do not control. Those components may change or be unavailable. Your app-store provider may apply its own terms to your download and use of the App.

11) Intellectual property and feedback
We and our licensors own the Service and its content, including software, design, branding, and documentation. All trademarks and logos remain the property of their owners. If you provide ideas or feedback, you grant us a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free license to use them to improve the Service without compensation.

12) Service changes and updates
We may add, change, or remove features; we may also update the App automatically. We aim for reliability but do not promise uninterrupted or error-free operation.

13) Termination
You may stop using the Service at any time and uninstall the App. We may suspend or terminate your access if you breach these Terms, if required by law, or if we discontinue the Service. Sections that reasonably should survive termination do survive (for example, ownership, disclaimers, liability limits, governing law).

14) Disclaimers
To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Service is provided “as is” and “as available.” We disclaim all warranties—express, implied, and statutory—including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, and the accuracy or availability of Outputs. Nothing here excludes warranties or rights that cannot be disclaimed by law.

15) Limitation of liability
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we and our affiliates, officers, and personnel are not liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages; or for lost profits, revenues, goodwill, or data; or for personal or property damage arising from unsafe use of AR features.
Aggregate cap. For claims arising out of or relating to the Service, our total liability in any twelve (12)-month period will not exceed the amounts you paid to us for the Service in that period (if any). This does not limit liability that cannot be limited by law.
Your responsibility. Where permitted by law, you agree to compensate us for reasonable losses and costs that directly result from your unlawful use of the Service or your breach of these Terms.

16) Consumers and non-excludable rights
If you use the Service as a consumer, you may have legal rights that these Terms cannot change. These Terms apply only to the extent permitted by those laws.

17) Governing law and venue 
To the extent a choice of law and forum may be selected, these Terms and any disputes arising out of or relating to them or the Service are governed by the laws of India, and you and we submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in India.
This clause does not reduce any mandatory protections you have under the laws of your country or state.

18) Changes to these Terms
If we make material changes, we will notify you by reasonable means (for example, in-App notice or version information). Updated Terms take effect when posted or, where required, after notice. Continued use means you accept the updated Terms. We may update in-app notices and safety messaging as features evolve.
