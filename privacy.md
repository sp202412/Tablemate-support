Tablemate Travel Lens — Privacy Policy

Effective date: 17 December 2025
Operator / Controller: “Tablemate Travel Lens” (“we,” “us,” “our”)
Contact: tablemateprices@gmail.com   

1) What this policy covers

This Privacy Policy explains what data the Tablemate Travel Lens mobile application (the “App”) and related services (together, the “Service”) process, why we process it, how long we keep it, how we secure it, and what choices and rights you have. If you do not agree with this Policy, do not use the Service.

2) Key definitions 

•	Augmented Reality (AR): computer-generated overlays that appear on your live camera view.
•	Optical Character Recognition (OCR): automated detection of text within images or video frames.
•	User Content: text or other material you submit or cause the App to process (for example, detected price strings or short notes).
•	Outputs: on-screen overlays, estimated currency conversions, translations, or explanations produced by the Service.

3) Summary: how Tablemate Travel Lens handles data

•	On-device first. Camera frames are processed on your device to detect text for AR overlays. We do not upload raw camera frames for core price detection.
•	Minimal network use. If you choose translation or explanation features, the App may send limited text snippets (not images) to our servers to generate an Output.
•	Rates & caching. The App may fetch and locally cache exchange-rate information to produce faster estimates.
•	Analytics & diagnostics. We collect basic usage metrics and crash diagnostics to operate, secure, and improve the Service.
•	No selling of personal data. We do not sell your personal data. We do not share data for third-party targeted advertising.

4) Data we process 

A. On-Device Processing (Not Sent to Us)

•	Camera frames and sensor readings used to render AR overlays and run OCR.
•	Transient detections produced by the device to place overlays.
•	Local preferences (e.g., selected currencies, UI settings) stored on your device.

A-1. App Permissions 

•	Camera: Required for AR overlays and OCR.
•	Local storage: Used for preferences and local caches (e.g., exchange-rate cache).
•	Network: Required for optional translations/explanations you activate and for analytics/crash diagnostics.

B. Data that may be transmitted to our servers (feature-dependent)

•	Text snippets derived from detected text (e.g., a price string like “€12.50”) when you request translation or explanation features. We do not need or request images for this.
•	Exchange-rate queries (currency codes, timestamps) to compute estimated conversions.
•	Limited technical metadata (e.g., request time, basic device/app version) to deliver the response and maintain service integrity.

C. Analytics and diagnostics

•	Event-level usage metrics (e.g., feature toggles, session counts, in-app flows) to understand general performance and reliability.
•	Crash logs and error reports (stack traces, device model, OS version, anonymized instance identifiers) to debug and stabilize the App.

D. Support communications

•	Emails or messages you send to us (contact details you provide, plus the message content). We use these to respond and to track issues.

We do not seek to collect

•	Precise geolocation, contacts, calendars, photos, or payment card numbers via the App.
•	Any government ID or biometric identifier.

If you voluntarily include such information in a support email, we will handle it only to address your request.

5) Why we process data 

We rely on different lawful bases depending on the activity and your location. We keep this simple and portable:

•	Provide the Service: Core functionality, exchange-rate queries, snippet processing for translations/explanations you invoke, and essential communications.
•	Security and integrity: Prevent abuse, detect service errors, and maintain reliable operations.
•	Analytics and product improvement: Understand performance, crashes, and feature adoption to improve quality. 
•	Compliance: Respond to lawful requests and maintain required records.
•	Consent (where you choose optional features). For example, enabling translation/explanation that sends a text snippet, or receiving product updates by email. You can withdraw consent at any time; this does not affect prior processing.

6) On-device vs. network processing 

•	On-device: Live camera frames, AR placement, and OCR happen locally. These data are ephemeral and not uploaded for core detection.
•	Network: Only short text snippets you trigger for translation/explanation, plus necessary technical metadata, are sent to our servers. Responses are returned to your device and the snippets are not retained longer than needed to produce the Output and ensure service reliability (see §9).
•	Rates: Exchange-rate lookups may occur periodically; results can be cached locally for responsiveness.

7) Sharing and disclosure

We share data only as necessary to provide and protect the Service:

•	Service providers (processors). Cloud hosting, analytics, crash reporting, and email support tools that act on our instructions.
•	Platform operators. App Store providers may receive basic device and purchase/installation metadata under their own terms.
•	Legal and safety. Where required by law or to protect rights, safety, and the integrity of the Service.
•	Business changes. If we undergo a change in control or asset transfer, we will ensure this Policy continues to apply or we will provide notice and choices.

8) International transfers

Our servers or providers may be located outside your country. When we transfer data internationally, we use appropriate safeguards where required (for example, standard contractual clauses or equivalent mechanisms) and limit transfers to what is necessary to deliver the Service.

9) Retention (how long we keep data)

We retain data only as long as needed for the stated purposes, then delete or de-identify it.

•	Text snippets for translations/explanations: retained transiently to generate Outputs and maintain service integrity, then deleted.
•	Exchange-rate cache on device: retained locally; you can clear app data to remove it.
•	Analytics (aggregated) are kept for reasonable periods to analyze trends and product health.
•	Crash logs are kept for a limited period to investigate and fix issues.
•	Support emails are kept as long as needed to resolve your request and meet minimal record-keeping needs.

10) Your choices and controls

•	Permissions. You can disable camera access in system settings; without camera, AR features will not work.
•	Feature toggles. You control whether to invoke translation/explanation (which sends a text snippet).
•	Analytics controls. Where offered, you can limit optional analytics in App settings and via platform privacy controls.
•	Data access and deletion. Delete local data by removing the App. For server-side items (e.g., support messages), contact us (see §14).

11) Your privacy rights 

Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, rectify, delete, port, or restrict processing of your personal data, and to object to processing based on legitimate interests, and to withdraw consent at any time (this does not affect past processing). You also may have the right to complain to a supervisory authority.
To exercise rights, contact us at tablemateprices@gmail.com. We will respond as required by applicable law.

12) Security

We use administrative, technical, and physical safeguards appropriate to the data we process (for example, encryption in transit, least-privilege access, and monitoring). No system can be perfectly secure; we cannot guarantee absolute security. If we become aware of a data incident affecting you, we will notify you and/or authorities as required by law.

13) Children

The Service is not directed to children under the age required by local law (e.g., 13). If a minor uses the App, a parent or legal guardian must review and accept the ToS and this Policy and supervise use. If you believe we have collected personal data from a child without appropriate consent, contact us and we will delete it.

14) How to contact us

For privacy questions or requests, contact: tablemateprices@gmail.com If we appoint a representative in your region, we will add those details here.

15) Changes to this Policy

We may update this Policy to reflect changes to the Service or legal requirements. If we make material changes, we will provide reasonable notice (for example, in-App notice or version information). The updated Policy takes effect when posted or, where required, after notice.
